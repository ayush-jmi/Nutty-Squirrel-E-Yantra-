Nutty Squirrel (NS)
Forests cover 31 percent of earth’s land and home for majority of the plants and animals found on earth. These plants and animals are integral to forest ecosystems and provide countless ecosystem benefits to humans. 

If we talk about a single animal say Squirrel and its lifestyle, in the last few decades, numerous studies and scientific publications have confirmed the fact that squirrels have a significant positive effect on seed dispersal and subsequently forest regeneration. 

Squirrels know when winter is arriving and start searching for food. They gather all the nuts they can during the fall and save them for future. They dig holes and bury the nuts close to their nests so that other squirrels can’t steal them. When they are hungry, they use their strong sense of smell to identify the nuts they have buried. A study from University of California at Berkeley 2017 claims that tree squirrels use a mnemonic technique called "spatial chunking" to sort out and bury their nut scores by size, type, and perhaps nutritional value and taste. 

How about depicting the behaviour of Squirrel through a robotic platform? 
Inspired by this idea, e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC-2018) introduces “Nutty Squirrel”, a theme depicting a robot mimicking the behaviour of a Squirrel storing Nuts in different places. 

In this theme, a robot and a lift mechanism is designed that depicts a Squirrel that sorts, carries and places nuts at different places on land and in trees. The challenges in this theme includes V-REP Simulation, Path Planning, building a Robot and Lift Mechanism, Sensor Interfacing, designing a mechanism to pick and place the Nuts. A configuration image will be given to teams. The arena consists of thermocol blocks of different colors that are placed randomly. The robot traverses the arena to pick up a block and place it at a designated section S1 and S2. The teams needs to make a lift mechanism to carry the bot at a certain height to place blocks at the designated section S3. 

The challenge is to complete this task in the shortest time possible and place the blocks at designated sections. The robots that perform the task best in accordance with the rules set for this task will be declared as the WINNER of the competition. 

All the Best!!!
